Example of the simplest possible configuration:

token: QWdsqEXAMPLETOKENqwerty
ip: 192.168.13.37
libraryName: Movies
entity: media_player.bedroom_tv # entity provided by cast integration
```

Example of the simplest possible configuration using multiple entities:

```
type: 'custom:plex-meets-homeassistant'
token: QWdsqEXAMPLETOKENqwerty
ip: 192.168.13.37
libraryName: Movies
entity:
  - media_player.living_room_nvidia_shield # created by androidtv integration
  - media_player.living_room_tv # created by cast integration
  - media_player.bedroom_tv # created by cast integration
  - media_player.kodi_123456qwe789rty # created by kodi integration
```

Example of card configuration using detailed definitions:

**Does not work through configuration UI because of plexPlayer key**

```
type: 'custom:plex-meets-homeassistant'
token: QWdsqEXAMPLETOKENqwerty
ip: 192.168.13.37
port: 32400
libraryName: TV Shows
protocol: http
maxCount: 10
sort: title:desc
entity:
  kodi: media_player.kodi_123456qwe789rty
  androidtv: media_player.living_room_nvidia_shield
  plexPlayer: 192.168.13.38
  cast: media_player.bedroom_tv
```

Complex example using detailed definitions, lists and shared plex server for plexPlayer:

**Does not work through configuration UI because of plexPlayer key**

```
type: 'custom:plex-meets-homeassistant'
token: QWdsqEXAMPLETOKENqwerty
ip: remote.plex.server.com # remote shared plex instance
port: 443
libraryName: Deck
protocol: https
maxCount: 10
sort: title:desc
runBefore: script.turn_on_tv_and_wait
runAfter: script.movie_time
showExtras: true
playTrailer: muted
entity:
  kodi:
    - media_player.kodi_bedroom
    - media_player.kodi_living_room
  androidtv:
    - media_player.living_room_nvidia_shield
    - media_player.bedroom_nvidia_shield
    - media_player.kithen_nvidia_shield
  plexPlayer:
    - identifier: TV 2020 # plex client device located on local plex server network
      server:
        ip: local.plex.server.com # Mandatory
        token: QWdsqEXAMPLETOKENqwerty # Mandatory
        port: 32400
        protocol: http
    - 192.168.13.50 # without definition for server, it will look for device on remote.plex.server.com network
  cast: media_player.bedroom_tv
```

In this example, it will try to first play via kodi, in bedroom. If that kodi is unavailable or off, it tries in living room kodi.
If that fails, it moves on to android tvs, starting with living room, continuing with bedroom and ending with kitchen.
Next, if a possible player still has not been found (all kodis and shields are off) it tries to play via plexPlayer, trying TV 2020 on local plex server and if not found, IP 192.168.13.50 on remote plex server.
Finally, it tries to cast into media_player.bedroom_tv.

## Detailed configuration instructions for end devices

**Unless you have a specific need to configure this part manually, such as remote plex server for plexPlayer, it is strongly advised to use UI to configure entities.**

_You can combine multiple supported entities_, in that case, entity for supported content will be chosen in order how you entered them.

As an example, if content can be played / shown both by kodi and androidtv, and you entered kodi first, it will be shown by kodi. If it cannot be played by kodi but can be played by androidtv, androidtv will be used.

This will also work with play button being shown, it will only show when you can actually play content on your device.

Play button is only visible if all the conditions inside Availability section of end devices below are met.

### Android TV or Fire TV

**Difficulty to setup**: Easy

**Steps**:

- Install plex application on your Android TV device. Open it and do the default setup so that you can see and navigate your libraries.
- Setup [Android TV](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/androidtv/). You need just a [default configuration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/androidtv/#configuration), no optional parameters needed.
- Use entity_id of media_player provided by Android TV integration in card, example: `androidtv: media_player.living_room_nvidia_shield`.

**Availability**:

- Provided entity ID needs to exists
- Provided entity ID needs to have attributes
- Provided entity ID needs to have attribute adb_response

- Install and configure integration [Kodi Recently Added Media](https://github.com/jtbgroup/kodi-media-sensors#installation) and its sensor **kodi_media_sensor_search**. For support of Live TV, if [this PR](https://github.com/jtbgroup/kodi-media-sensors/pull/5) has not been merged yet, you need to use [this modified](https://github.com/JurajNyiri/kodi-media-sensors/tree/add_channels_search) integration with support for PVR.

### All other plex clients

**Difficulty to setup**: Very Easy to Moderate

**Steps**:

_Easy setup_:

Notice: While easy, it might not work if you have multiple devices with the same name, or you buy a second device with the same name in the future. Some plex clients also incorrectly report theirs IP Address, so addition by that might not be working. Take a look at Machine ID setup below if this is a concern for you.

- Open Plex app on the device you wish to add
- Open your Plex web GUI
- Click on cast on the top right corner and note down name of your device

![Plex cast](images/plex_player/1.png)

- Add it to card, example:

```
entity:
  plexPlayer: TV 2020
```

Instead of device name, you can also enter device IP address or product name.

- Save card configuration, if you see play buttons everywhere configuration was successful.

If you do not see play button, or have multiple devices with the same name, follow Machine ID setup below.

_Machine ID setup_:

- Open Plex app on the device you wish to add
- Open your Plex web GUI
- Modify URL so that just after the port, just after the first slash, you enter `clients?X-Plex-Token=PLEX_TOKEN`. Replace PLEX_TOKEN with your plex token. Example final URL `http://192.168.13.37:32400/clients?X-Plex-Token=qweRTY123456`.
- You will get a list of all currently connected Plex clients.
- Find the client you wish to add, and copy machineIdentifier key without quotes.
- Add machineIdentifier into card, for example:

```
entity:
  plexPlayer: mYaweS0meMacHin3Id3ntiFI3r
```

- Save card configuration, if you see play buttons everywhere configuration was successful.

**Availability**:

- Plex needs to run on the defined device

**Supported**:

✅ Shared Plex servers _\*requires additional configuration, see below_

✅ Movies

✅ Show

✅ Season

✅ Episodes

✅ Artists

✅ Albums

✅ Tracks

❌ Live TV

**Shared Plex servers configuration**

plexPlayer can be configured in multiple ways, achieving the same thing:

```
entity:
  plexPlayer: TV 2020
```

```
entity:
  plexPlayer:
    - TV 2020
```

```
entity:
  plexPlayer:
    identifier: TV 2020
```

```
entity:
  plexPlayer:
    - identifier: TV 2020
```

As can be seen from the last two examples, it is possible to configure it as an object having key "identifier".

That is useful, if you want to stream media from shared or remote Plex server. Add information about your local Plex server which sees your device on which you wish to play content. This is done by including a new key, "server" having additional keys:

Example 1:

```
entity:
  plexPlayer:
    - identifier: TV 2020
      server:
        ip: 192.168.13.37 # Mandatory
        token: QWdsqEXAMPLETOKENqwerty # Mandatory
        port: 32400
        protocol: http
```

Example 2:

```
entity:
  plexPlayer:
    identifier: TV 2020
    server:
      ip: 192.168.13.37 # Mandatory
      token: QWdsqEXAMPLETOKENqwerty # Mandatory
      port: 32400
      protocol: http
```

## Sorting

You can use _:desc_ or _:asc_ after every value to change the order from ascending to descending. For example, titlesort would become titleSort:asc, or titleSort:desc.
